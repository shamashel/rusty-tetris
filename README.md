# rusty-tetris

This is a project I'm making to help me learn rust.

The idea here is to build a working tetris clone without using any code tutorials/stackoverflow questions/etc. Library docs and math tutorials are allowed, same goes for looking up a generic stuff (i.e. `rotating a 4x4 matrix` is fine, but `rotating a tetromino` is not).

## Why?

I generally find that the best way to learn a language is to first build something with it. I've also personally found that following a step-by-step tutorial tends to lead to not actually retaining any information, so I'm trying to avoid that.

I know this has been done before and I'm pretty sure it will be done again. This is just a silly way for me to get more comfortable with rust before trying to apply it to something closer to my day job (or an open source project).
